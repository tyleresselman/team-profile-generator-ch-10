  # Team Profile Generator - Challenge 10

  ## Description: 
  The purpose of this project was to use object-oriented programming principles to build a node.js command-line application to take in employee information for a team and generate an HTML webpage to display said information. I feel like I made good progress on this challenge working out my flow for generating code. I am still growing in my ability to translate certain principles of what we've learned into use for this backend work. To that end I still have much work to do finishing out the functionality of this app. But I feel as though I laid the foundation.
